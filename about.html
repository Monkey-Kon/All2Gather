                help you connect with teammates and set up the game, so all you need to do is show up, play, and
                enjoy. Team sports are all about fun and good times. We'll make sure it stays that way!

                <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                <p>Perceiving the world of sport as a welcoming and uplifting community for everybody, we strive for a
                    world, where the managing process of sports gets sidelined as the enjoyment and social aspect take
                    the field. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="checkmark">✔</span> <strong>Stronger Together</strong>
                        <p>At All2gather, we believe teamwork is as crucial in life as on the court. For many the world
                            of team sports is a gateway to social interaction and forming strong bonds and an
                            introduction to being a part of something bigger than the individual- a team. This value
                            symbolizes the trust a team should have in each other and the importance of being able to
                            rely on one another. After all the individual does not have a chance against the mass,
                            because we are stronger together.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="checkmark">✔</span> <strong>Enjoy Yourself</strong>
                        <p>Despite all the wins that team sports bring to a person, arguably the most valuable one is
                            the
                            pleasure it brings to the soul when participating. The hardships, competitiveness and high
                            goals
                            can easily stop this emotion from playing a sport, but it is important to remember that,
                            despite
                            of the outcome, the most important thing is to remember why you started in the beginning. We
                            believe everyone has their own style and way of doing things. That is why at All2Gather we
                            do
                            not judge anybody, but always encourage them to have fun! So, grab your gear, bring your
                            mates,
                            and let’s play!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="checkmark">✔</span> <strong>Sport is for Everyone</strong>
                        <p>A great team is built with people possessing different abilities, that complement each other
                            so well that they work like one. At All2Gather we think each person, with their unique
                            abilities has a place in a team and in the world of sports. There is a huge variety of team
                            sports, each different from the other and unique in its own way, just like us humans. That’s
                            why this value represents our belief that no matter who you are, where do you come from or
                            what your interests are, everyone has a place in team sports. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="checkmark">✔</span> <strong>Keep Moving</strong>
                        <p>At All2Gather, we believe that ‘keep moving’ is more than just a physical activity- it’s a
                            mindset. Consistency is the only road to reaching progress and success. Overcoming any
                            obstacle
                            only makes the next one smaller and easier to win over. Giving up has never made greatness,
                            so
                            instead we push through showing resilience in the process. We believe everyone has the power
                            in
                            them to do the same, and we are here to suport them in the process. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="checkmark">✔</span> <strong>Push your limits</strong>
                        <p>Not only is playing sports fun, but it is also challenging. Here at All2Gather we believe
                            that progress is at the core of every action. We trust in everyone's ability to improve and
                            go further than they ever thought they could. Pushing the boundaries of what is possible,
                            while still experiencing the fun side of sports. By exceeding your limits sport becomes more
                            pleasurable and easy to commit to. We stand for encouraging others to do the best to their
                            abilities, so together we are getting better every day.</p>
