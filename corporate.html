        <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
        <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A colour scheme (with HTML colour codes, which must be consistent with your final website)
            <em>&mdash; see the example below from the BUas brand book:</em>
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
              <li>
                <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #006620;"></span>
                #006620
                <em>We asked people what colour they affiliate with sports and they said green and some other colors, we
                  think green is a good natrual color to use as main color.

                </em>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #D6FF62;"></span>
                #D6ff62
                <em>Since the main green is a bit darker we wanted to have a different lighter green to make things more
                  readable while maintaining the overall feel of the website.</em>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FFF7ED;"></span>
                #FFF7ED
                <em>White is always a good basic color to put everything on, but just pure white is to bright and not
                  always right. So we picked an off-white to use white while still making everything look good.</em>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #5072FF;"></span>
                #5072FF
                <em>Blue also came up in our interviews, we think that this is a good contrasting colour to green. So we
                  use it to make everything look a bit more unique. This colour is mostly used for buttons!</em>
              </li>
            </ul>

          <li>We have been browsing through various fonts. There were none that were something that we were really
            hoping for, but some where close enough.
            We have been using: <strong>"Boldonse"</strong> as main headings, it looks good and can be read easily while
            having a fun
            vibe.
            Also: <strong>"Slabo 27px"</strong> has been used for the normal text. It looks sporty and is still quite
            readable. Reading
            with this font will not become a sport.
          </li>
          <li>We have chosen to make the experience easy to read through. There are cards that can be
            <strong>highlighted</strong> in the

            <ul>
              <li>The site fits to the content, because we consitently spoke in the way that our brand wants to been

        <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
        <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
        <p>Our brand All2Gather created and launched a month-long multi-platform social-media marketing campaign called
          Huddle Up during the period between March 17th and April 17th. At its essence, the campaign was produced and
          executed for the purpose of developing a new and broader audience and building a strong connection between
          them and our brand. Huddle Up was made to speak to its audience directly in their tone of voice, which also
          corresponds to the values of All2Gather as a brand. Therefore, the feel of Huddle Up is exciting and
          encouraging as the goal it was trying to achieve, was to show the public that sport does not only have health
          benefits but is also immensely pleasurable to the soul and it should be enjoyed by everyone. To fulfil that
          goal our team made use of the media channels Instagram and TikTok to create a platform, where we could post
          photo and video content in order to successfully communicate our message to our audience and spike their
          interest towards the brand so they could visit our website and for them to actively engage with our site and
          brand. To keep track of our progress we set clear goals, which we would constantly compare to and try and
          fulfil.


          <ul>
            <li><strong>Reach:</strong> To have reached 2000 people/accounts between both platforms before the 15th of
              April measured
              through
              the analytics of both social-media platforms.</li>
            <li><strong>Affect:</strong> To have all accounts that engage with our content feel joyful, humorous and
              relatable throughout
              the
              whole month ending April 17th, measured through the user generated tools provided on Instagram stories.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Response:</strong> To have 250 people/accounts interact with our content and to have gained 130
              followers between
              both
              platforms before the 15th of April measured through the analytics of both social-media platforms.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After extended research into our target audience, 16–35-year-olds, living in the Netherlands, etc., (this
            can
            be seen through the personas we created) we concluded that the most fitting social-media platforms to
            execute
            the Huddle Up campaign would be Instagram and TikTok. Both platforms are in the Top 5 most popular amongst
            Gen
            Z and st Gen Z and Millennials living in the Netherlands (William & William, 2024). Moreover, we
            considered
            those two platforms for their focus on user generated content, as they are one of the leading ones in that
            segment (UMATechnology, 2025). Working with the “for you page” approach specialised for each user meant
            they
            would allow us to easily find the right audience interested in our product and easily make their
            engagement
            consistent. Furthermore, this approach and these features, uch as duets and challenges, on TikTok, and
            stories, on Instagram. This makes them the perfect space for All2Gather to create a sense of familiarity
            in
            its viewers and build emotional connection with their audience, fulfilling its goal. To further support
            this
            decision, our team conducted interviews with participants from our target group, who confirmed that those
            two
            platforms are, where they consume and engage with sport content. Taking all these insights into
            consideration,
            our team carefully created the campaign around those two social media platforms and the tools that they
            offer.
          </p>
          </ul>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Activities</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Our team launched the Huddle Up campaign on Match 17th on Instagram and after
              two
              days followed on
              TikTok. We were coming up with and creating original content according to our brand style and image. We
              posted
              one post, one reel and a few stories on Instagram and one video on TikTok, which were all doing really
              well
              in
              numbers.</li>
            <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Unfortunately, after a week our Instagram account got permanently deleted and
              all
              our process lost
              with it. We were unable to recover the account, nor the numbers and accounts reached we have gathered so
              we
              had to create a new account and start from scratch. Thankfully as we were creating original content, we
              had
              saved our work and re-uploaded it on our new account and gained 34 followers back. Though for us that was
              a
              big setback, we were fortunate that it happened at the start of our campaign and still had the opportunity
              to
              recover and learn from our mistakes. Setting up our new account we made sure to make one team member
              responsible for its management, so we do not go against the restrictions Instagram has regarding how many
              people manage a business account. Having said that, this was still a significant setback, which forced us
              to
              adjust our plans and the already set social media calendar. This only cost us to lose even more time than
              the
              one we already did. Unfortunately, we let this setback steal a part of our enthusiasm and determination
              and
              we
              lost over a week of posting on both platforms. </li>
            <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> At the start of week 3 we figured that time was not the only thing we had lost
              because we had lost
              94% of reach compared to the previous week with only 70 views and 34 accounts reached on Instagram and 113
              views and 42 accounts reached on TikTok. Thankfully, we were able to recover and started posting again.
              During
              that week we focused more on video content than anything else, which was received well by our audience. It
              generated 1,069 views and 628 accounts reached on Instagram. </li>
            <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> This week was our strongest one as we posted the most. On Instagram we had
              uploaded
              one reel, two
              posts and a few user generated stories for our followers to engage with. All together they had led to
              4,514
              views on our profile, 1,716 accounts reached and a few new followers (we cannot provide the specific
              number
              as
              Instagram does not provide detailed information for accounts under 100 followers). Visibly the video
              content
              was the most appealing to our audience as it had double the views and interactions that the photo content
              got.
              On TikTok we uploaded two videos as the first reached 2,061 views and the other - only 780. Having said
              that,
              the video with more views got 54 likes, 36 less than the one with less, making us consider it more
              successful
              as it reached the right audience of a more niche group of users. </li>
            <li><strong>Week 5:</strong> The last week of our campaign was also a strong one. On Instagram we uploaded
              one
              reel, two posts
              and a couple of stories, which generated 2,593 views, reached 615 accounts and brought the number of our
              followers to 62. On TikTok we again uploaded two videos, which relatively got 58 views and 13 likes and
              839
              views and 52 likes setting and end to our campaign. </li>
            <li><strong>Summary:</strong> Looking at the insights in 5 weeks our TikTok profile got 4,228 views, 253
              likes,
              13 comments, 24
              shares and 12 followers, which we reached almost solely through getting on the For you page of our
              audience.
              On the other hand, for four weeks on Instagram we got 10,195 views, 2,411 accounts reached, 226
              interactions,
              61 followers.

              Based on the statistics we can conclude that our Instagram account was more successful than the TikTok
              one,
              which could be attributed to our main focus being on it. Furthermore, based on the interactions of each
              post
              we also concluded that our audience preferred video content over photo content and is the most satisfied
              with
              relatable user generated content personalised to them.

              Though we surpassed our reach objective and fulfilled our affect objective, we did not fulfil our response
              objective as we gathered 73 followers, and we were reaching for 130. </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>During this month-long campaign our team experienced a lot of surprises and unexpected turns of events that
            taught us a few very valuable lessons. From the very beginning this experience showed us that, though
            enthusiasm and creativity are really important, a campaign cannot be driven solely on them. Having to start
            over with our account showed us the importance of proper planning, execution and division of work. It also
            thought us to be prepared for everything, having a plan does not ensure that sometimes unexpected
            circumstances may occur. Furthermore, we learned how important consistency is. Our team let something
            unexpected to set us back and steal useful time, which may have been crucial for reaching our goal. If we
            have
            been posting during week 2, we would have increased our numbers in general, which may have affected our
            followers enough to reach our goal. The last thing we learned is the clear distinction between the two
            social
            medias. Though they share a lot of similarities and at their essence their usage is video content, the way
            that the two operate is very different. Therefore, your approach as a brand should also differ per platform,
            which we should have worked on more. </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>When looking back on the process, there are some key insights that we got from running the Huddle Up
            campaign.
            This way we know how to properly plan a social media campaign in the future. Some key insights are that
            planning
            what the exact content you want to post in advance is important for keeping a structured plan. This way you
            can
            meet deadlines and post your content in time. Another key insight is that on Instagram reels get pushed more
            and
            therefore also get more views. Furthermore, following trends does not equal views. Usually, the content that
            we
            make ourselves and user generated content gets pushed more by both Instagram and TikTok. Lastly, we focused
            a
            lot on Instagram due to our account getting permanently banned and wanting to get engagement up there.
            Meanwhile, we did not realise that we should have also focused on TikTok as we were making significant
            numbers
            in engagement and views.
          </p>


          <p>Keeping this in mind, as well as our learning points. We created a plan. The upcoming month it will go as
            follows:</p>



          <p>At first, we will focus more on content planning. Having all the elements work smoothly was not necessarily
            easy, but planning content, keeping up a campaign with a tone of voice in mind is key to running a smooth
            campaign. Therefore, in the future, we will plan and come up with each post in advance and make sure
            production
            is also planned so we have most of our content ready before the campaign starts.</p>



          <p>The next step we want to make is run a campaign based with our values in mind. With our Campaign
            #GatherTheGame
            we can keep our brands mission, vision and values as a main focus. By this campaign we cover the values:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bring people with different backgrounds together through a shared interest.</li>
            <li>Make sports available to people that don't have the time or money.</li>
            <li>Enjoyment to be the focus when practicing a sport.</li>
            <li>For each player to feel that they have a place when practising a sport.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For our plan, we also want to focus on TikTok more. Not only because it is a gate to a more niche audience,
            but also because it gets more engagement. Therefore, boosting our site in the process. Not only that but
            posting more will also get our engagement up. By learning from our mistakes, we want to schedule to post on
            TikTok every two days. We will also want to do a story post linking our TikTok video with a CTA link to
            Instagram. Furthermore, want to post on Instagram every three times a week. As we can see the engagement
            with
            our content on Instagram is more from our followers. </p>
          <p>Due to our account getting deleted we got a little discouraged and we did not post as consistently so we
            would like to keep posting content at set hours as well. Boosting the reach we have. </p>
          <p>As for the content itself we would like to run a more niche campaign by having our users engage more. We
            want
            to do this by making interactive stories on Instagram such as quizzes and questions. And on TikTok we saw an
            increase in comments if we asked a question in a post. Therefore, we will be doing more posts such as “which
            team sport are you?”. Furthermore, we would like to set up a budget to do small giveaways like a month free
            for users who can generate content such as using our audio, this way we can utilize user generated content
            and
            boost engagement at the same time. For example, “#GatherTheGame Assemble your team (the popular one, The one
            with all the training tips, the one that is always late, the one that is only there for the after game
            drinks)” by using audio’s that we create and letting people use that audio we gather original content while
            getting the most out of user generated content. </p>
          <p>When looking at our reach objectives and the way to get to the goals we set for ourselves, we can tell that
            our content should be mostly reels on Instagram, posts with popular music and good quality visuals for
            TikTok.
            We could see for example on TikTok that a video with a high production value might have not been seen by as
            many people, but the number of likes was up. This way you boost your followers and people that want to come
            back to our page. However, on Instagram Where we saw the most engagement were funny video’s we created and
            participating in trends. Therefore, we will focus more on that on Instagram. </p>
          <p>Lastly, we would like to set new reach objectives for the campaign. These are based on what we reached by
            posting last month as well as our new strategy and the amount of time planned out for our next campaign.
            First
            of all, we would like to divide the objectives for both TikTok and Instagram making reach objectives for
            both.
            First Instagram:</p>

              checking online
              spaces we gathered that our target demographic / users often and regularly struggle with finding teammates

              order to (hopefully mostly) prevent entire matches and games from falling through. Which is also why the
              reminders and RSVPs are added features, so people do not forget a match is happening if they have signed
              up
              for it. </li>
            <li>In-app drills and improvement tips personalized or community driven.
              <strong>- Justification:</strong> One of the three major problems we found from desk research and our
              interviews, was that
              when people try to work out or practice sports at home, they often are not aware or don't know the right
              techniques, which in some cases has led to injuries. This is why we’re adding in-app drills and
              improvement
              tips to our platform in order to try and circumvent this. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>16–35-year-old people that live in The Netherlands that play sports for fun
              <strong>- Justification:</strong> according to Loketgezondleven.nl [1] age group 12 to 17 sport the most
              often with 76% and
              of the age group adults of ages 18 to 65 about 58% play sports. Because we wanted to reach our target
              demographic mainly through social media, we decided to narrow down the age group to 16–35-year-olds
              because
              according to frankwatching.com [2] the amount of Gen z (14 to 27-year-olds) and millennials (28 to
              42-year-olds) who use social media weekly is above 80%. </li>
            <li>Early adopters - People that want to play but still not have a club.
              <strong>- Justification:</strong> Early adopters tend to be a transitional group actively looking for
              connection, which is
              why we decided to include them in our target demographic. They fit the UVP of “casual, social-first" and
              are
              also more likely to be flexible and open to new digital solutions like our product. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A casual, social-first sports platform for finding teammates, organizing games, and improving skills.
              <strong>- Justification:</strong> We want to emphasize vibe, flexibility and fun with our platform, so our
              users can focus
              simply on their sports journey / their team sport while we take care of the more bureaucratic side of
              things. These values are not typically offered in already existing and established platforms like TeamSnap
              or MeetUp. </li>
            <li>Low-pressure, vibe-based matchmaking with built-in planning tools. </li>
            <li>Everything in one place: team formation, scheduling, and learning.
              <strong>- Justification:</strong> Our UVP promotes the idea of “everything in one place” because some of
              our
              interviewees
              mentioned finding the fragmentation / separation of tools for communication, coordination and improvement
              annoying and difficult to keep up with after a while. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Deep understanding of the casual/amateur sports user journey.
              <strong>- Justification:</strong> A majority of the people on our team have played team-based sports
              before
              or actively does
              so, which gives us an understanding of the journey people tend to go through while playing or getting into
              playing team sports. </li>
            <li>Focus on vibe and flexibility over competition and performance.
              <strong>- Justification:</strong> since inflexibility is the core of one of our problems and from the
              problem interviews, we
              learned our target demographic feels it is difficult to join clubs / team sports because people put too
              much
              focus on performance, we’ve decided to bring the focus back to having fun and forming bonds, and making
              those things some of our core values. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Social media (Instagram, TikTok) with fun, authentic, shareable content.
              <strong>- Justification:</strong>Based on our interviews our target audience uses social media to consume
              sports content
              (training tips, funny videos etc) and is highly and mainly active on the platforms listed (Instagram &
              TikTok), hence why we’ve chosen to use those channels to reach them. </li>
            <li>Word of mouth through friends, universities, or sports clubs.
              <strong>- Justification:</strong> a good part of our target demographic says to have attempted to play
              team
              sports through
              sports clubs or universities (though the issue of plans falling through, money etc came back there
              frequently), hence why we’ve listed it as a channel, because if we are able to strike a partnership or
              deal
              with said universities or sports clubs we’ll be able to reach our target demographic through word of mouth
              or other physical advertisements there too. </li>
            <li>Influencer and community partnerships, especially among students.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Number of games created or joined.</li>
            <li>User retention and repeat participation.
              <strong>- Justification:</strong> User retention and repeat participation on our platform measures whether
              or not we’re
              actually solving the issues / problems we’ve established our target demographic to have. If users are
              coming
              back and playing in games on a frequent basis, then not only are our matchmaking and planning features
              working successfully we’re also doing what we set out to do. </li>
            <li>Frequency of app use and engagement with features (e.g., chats, tips).
              <strong>- Justification:</strong> Though the tips and chats are not the main features of our platform, but
              rather secondary
              supportive features, if there is strong engagement from users in this area that suggest they see our
              platform as more than a simple scheduling tool which aligns with our UVP </li>
            <li>Amount of people visiting the site and click through rate from social media platforms </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Advertisements
              <strong>- Justification:</strong>Advertisements allow the app and platform to stay free for users and
              casual users, while we
              are able to use it as a stream of revenue to sustainour platform. On top of that a lot of our target
              audience is already used to ads because of social media platforms, and in some of our solution interviews
              our interviewees said they do not mind advertisements in an app or website if it means it stays free for
              them to use.</li>
            <li>Website Premium: freemium model of the app itself: core features are free, premium perks for
              €2–€5/month.
              <strong>- Justification:</strong> Casual users tend to resist (high) upfront fees. The freemium model
              therefore allows trial
              and habit to form, which makes it easier to upsell features like priority matching or exclusive content.
              And
              a lot of our interviewees say they are not unwilling to pay a small price to gain access to extra /
              exclusive features / content. </li>
            <li>Optional fees for events, coaching, or drills.</li>
            <li>Renting the facilities</li>
            <li>Renting the equipment</li>
            <li>Sponsorships, ads, and club/venue collaborations</li>

          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
          <ul>
            <li>App development and ongoing platform maintenance.
              <strong>- Justification:</strong> Because our product is app and platform (website) based keeping up with
              the maintenance and
              general upkeep is essential to sustain our business. On top of that, it is important to be consistent with
              updates and (potentially needed) bug fixes.</li>
            <li>Marketing via ads, influencers, and content production.</li>
            <li>Community support and moderation.</li>
            <li>Salaries</li>
            <li>Renting Facilities </li>
            <li>Equipment upkeep
              <strong>- Justification:</strong> Because our service also offers users to rent equipment in cases where
              they do not own the
              needed equipment themselves nor are they willing or able to afford it themselves, it is crucial to keep
              the
              equipment we rent out in good shape. This also helps sports stay affordable (a point that was also
              mentioned
              multiple times during interviews was that sports clubs were too expensive.) </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our service is a website and app called All2Gather where we provide a platform for amateur sports
              players
              and people who want to play team sports but are not able to currently. Users are able to easily create and
              join existing matches, find teams based on vibes and organise training sessions themselves, and get the
              bureaucratic side of things out of the way quickly so they can dedicate their time to doing what they
              enjoy.
              Playing team sports! This contributes to our unique value proposition because we keep everything in one
              place to make it easier for users to navigate but above all keep the focus on providing a casual,
              social-first sports platform for finding teammates, organising games, and improving skills. The brand
              image
              we’ve developed is all about being relaxed, welcoming, and social—bringing people together in an
              easy-going
              way that makes team sports feel fun, inclusive, and about more than just competition. Which matches what
              our
              service offers</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p><strong>First lean canvas</strong></p>

          <p>Like most brands the initial idea for our brand All2Gather was quite different from what we ended up
            creating.
            At the start of this project our team had the idea of creating a platform that will match amateur teams and
            players with venues around the Netherlands. That was the case as before any research our team got together
            and
            based on personal experiences and information gathered previously, in class we recognised the main gap in
            the
            industry to be the lack of available and affordable places for teams to practice their sport and compete in.
            Based on that it led us to believe this is the lead for four problems tied to one another: lack of space,
            lack
            of consistency, lack of technique and high risk of injuries. For this reason, we came up with a website idea
            that would provide three solutions to the recognised problems: providing a rich library of venues listed on
            our website, create a reservation system for them and providing tips for better sills. We were going to make
            it subscription based as the venue reservation and fee would have gone through our website, so our revenue
            streams would come from our users but also the venues which we promote on our platform.</p>



          <p><strong>Problem Interviews and Second Lean canvas</strong></p>

          <p>With this idea in mind, we created our Problem interviews and gathered information from 10 representatives
            from our target group (16 - 35-year-old amateur team sports athletes, living in The Netherlands, etc.).
            During
            the interviews most of the interviewees did recognise some of the problems me have mentioned – lack of
            technique and high risk of injuries, but also completely disregarded the rest. The problem they were facing
            was not so much with not being able to find a venue to practice their desired sport at, but rater finding a
            suitable club to join. Many expressed that as they practice a sport non-professionally the level of each
            team
            or even the teammates itself vary a lot. This goes in the way of their ability to properly play the sport at
            their level and have the safe space to create progress. Furthermore, they expressed their discomfort with
            planning games and matches as it was stealing the joy out of their sport. For this reason, after those
            interviews, our team rethought the idea and purpose of our brand and mended it to fit the problem raised by
            our target audience, while still including the problems they recognised. Based on our new brand idea we
            created our second lean canvas, which focused on three problems - Lack of suitable clubs, lack of technique,
            planning is blocking enjoyment, with those solutions: a feature that allows you to create your own team,
            offering great tips, providing seamless planning</p>



          <p><strong>Solution interviews</strong></p>

          <p>Based on our new idea and the second lean canvas, our team created solution interviews focusing on their
            quality regarding how well they solve the already recognised problems. The team interviewed the same ten
            people for maximum effectiveness. Mostly the feedback was positive, and the interviewees were agreeing with
            the solutions we had come up with, recognising them as pretty successful.</p>
